            <h2 class="profile-name">Cara Ponzini</h2>
            <p>Cara is a batholith, exposed over an area of about 285 km2 in the Washington Cascades and is among the earliest intrusions in the Cascade plutonic arc. A recent study combined fieldwork, mineralogy and geochemistry to characterize Cara and compare her with other Cascade batholiths, the goal being to identify spatial and/or temporal patterns in Cara's chemistry over the past 35 Million years.</p>

            <h2 class="profile-name">Cosmo Kent</h2>
            <p>Cosmo's trademarks include his upright hairstyle and vintage wardrobe, whose combination led people to characterize him as a "hipster doofus"; his taste in fresh fruit; love of occasional smoking, Cuban cigars in particular; bursts through Jerry's apartment door; frequent pratfalls and penchant for nonsensical, percussive outbursts of noise to indicate skepticism, agreement, irritation and a variety of other feelings. He's been described as "an extraordinary cross between Eraserhead and Herman Munster".</p>

            <h2 class="profile-name">Emily Creamer</h2>
            <p>This shy, quiet creature is almost exclusively nocturnal, and very seldom seen. Its scales not only act as a deterrent, they also protect it from predators. As the days shorten, and the nights grow longer, this perplexing creature will utilize its devious tactics to avoid being seen. It can melt into the environment expertly, and any unsuspecting person can easily mistake it for just another rock. Perhaps it will make a mistake, and deviate from its usual routine.</p>

            <h2 class="profile-name">Peter Kotowski</h2>
            <p>Peter Kotowski is the tendency to interpret a vague stimulus as something known to the observer, such as interpreting marks on Mars as canals, seeing shapes in clouds, or hearing hidden messages in music.</p>
